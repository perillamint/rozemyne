# Project Rozemyne
The better digital asset library & archive software.

!!! Currently in an early stage of development. Not functional yet !!!

## Why not Calibre?
There is Calibre, the e-book management software. However, Calibre does not provide good enough metadata management and classification system for mid and large-sized personal/shared libraries (> 1000 books). This project aims to solve the problem by

* Provide a modern web interface to manage books without fearing edit conflict between file-synced instances
* Provide a more organized tagging system inspired by the [Colon Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_classification) system.

## Features

* Powered by Rust (and aims blazing fast)
* Web Interface (WIP)
* Advanced tag and metadata management (WIP)
* OpenID Connect support

## Setup and Running
### Build
### Run
### Unit test

## Configuration
To Be determined.
